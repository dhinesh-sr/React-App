# Country Information Web App

This project comprises a React frontend and a Node.js backend server that fetches country information from an external API.

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed

### Starting the Backend Server
1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed:

   $ node -v
   
   $ npm -v

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

   
  $ cd backend

3. Start the Node.js server:

  $ node server.js

The backend server will start running

### Running the Frontend Application

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

$ cd frontend

2. Install dependencies:

$ npm install

3. Start the React application:

$ npm start

The front-end application will start in development mode. Access it in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (while running on the local server).


Notes:

Make sure the backend server is running before using the front-end application.
Ensure proper connectivity between the front end and backend for data retrieval.
Update the backend and frontend URLs if deploying to different environments.
